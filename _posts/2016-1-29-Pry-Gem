title: Pry Gem

My class at [NYCDA](http://nycda.com/) had an assignment this week: Pick a well-documented Ruby gem, learn how it works, write a [readme](https://github.com/stevenrayesky/pry_app) for it, and present it in class. 

I chose the Pry gem, which is a alternative to Ruby's default interactive environment repl, IRB. Honestly, I at first I was not entirely sure as to what I was getting myself into, but I knew it involved the command line and that was enough for me!

First, I learned what repl means. It stands for (loop (print (evaluate (read)))). What does that mean? Well, it takes something in(read), (evaluate)s it, and (print)s returns it. That is the loop.

An example being:

```
1 $ 1 + 2
2 $ => 3
3 $
```

* On line one you input `1 + 2`.
* It is read, evaluated and returned on line two as `3`.
* Line three it is ready to receive input again.

Both IRB pry,
