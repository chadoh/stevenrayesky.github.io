Hi! I'm Steven Rayesky, a budding web developer at New York Code
& Design Academy in Philadelphia. I am learning HTML, CSS, 
Javascript, Ruby and the Rails framework (and anything else I can find time for). I am flexing my 
creativity and growing as a developer as I design and build web applications.

I am a happily married man to my beautiful wife Jenna and father 
to our two children, Winifred and Theodore. Along with pursuing 
web development my wife and I run an event company specializing 
in floral design and weddings. Jenna is incredibly gifted and I 
am excited to soon use my newfound skills to increase our exposure.

Winnie is a firecracker who loves to talk (as any 2-year-old does) 
and is passionate about princesses and dinosaurs. At 4 months old 
Theo is rolling (more to come)!
