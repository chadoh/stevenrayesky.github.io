Hi! I'm Steven Rayesky. What else. 

I am a storyteller from birth, web developer by choice. I spent a number of years in sales and was always seeking a way to scratch that interminable itch: 

## The need to create!

By divine favor I stumbled into coding, and found the blend that matched my internal makeup: Logic + Creativity + Problem-solving = Love. 

I enrolled at NYCDA Philly where I was immersed in front/back-end development, collaborated on projects, and acquired the skills necessary to be a full-stack developer. 

My first love is my beautiful wife Jenna and our two children, Winifred and Theodore. 

Family, coding, reading, writing.
